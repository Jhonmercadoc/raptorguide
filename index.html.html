    <h1>Assassination Rogue guide</h1>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Assassination Rogues are fast-hitting murderers, utilizing their low damage but ultra instinct-like super speed
        <br />
        melee attacks and poisons to disable their enemies. Their gameplay uses very few elements of stealth, choosing
        <br />
        instead to venture headfirst directly into the battlefield, rapidly attacking enemies in a killing spree.
    </p>

    <h2>TALENTS BUILD</h2>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Ideal for early game Assassination, this is the build you will likely use during phase 1. it relies less on
        stats and more on getting your actual abilities and combo points rolling
